## Image Object Detection for Distributor Salesmenâ€™s Customer Visits

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a computer vision-based solution to streamline 
the image verification process for FMCG distributor admins. 
Salesmen visiting customers are required to capture and submit 5-10 
photos per customer as proof of visit, often including selfies, 
product displays, competitor surveys, and promotional materials. 
With each salesman visiting 25-40 customers daily, admins face the tedious task of manually reviewing up to 400 images per salesman every day. 
By implementing an image object detection system, this solution will automatically validate submitted images against admin-defined criteria, 
such as ensuring the presence of a face in selfies or verifying product displays. 
This automation reduces administrative workload, enhances efficiency, and ensures compliance with visit requirements.
